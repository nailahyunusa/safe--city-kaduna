PWA (Progressive Web App) SETUP FOR SAFECITY KADUNA
====================================================

WHAT WAS FIXED:
1. Updated manifest.json with:
   - Proper start_url and scope (using ./ for relative paths)
   - Embedded SVG icons (no external image files needed)
   - Description and categories
   - Maskable icon support for adaptive icons

2. Enhanced service-worker.js with:
   - Correct file paths (admin-panel.html instead of admin-dashboard.html)
   - All necessary HTML, CSS, and JS files in cache list
   - Proper install/activate/fetch event handlers
   - Error handling for offline scenarios
   - Cache versioning support

3. Improved service worker registration in HTML files:
   - Better error handling
   - Update detection for new versions
   - Installation prompt detection


HOW TO TEST THE APP:
====================

DESKTOP (Chrome/Edge):
1. Open your project in a local web server (NOT file://)
   Example: Use Python: python -m http.server 8000
   Then visit: http://localhost:8000

2. Open DevTools (F12) → Application → Manifest
   - Should show all manifest fields green (valid)

3. Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
   - Should show "Service Worker Registered"
   - Status should be "activated and running"

4. Click the address bar or look for "Install App" button
   - You should see an option to install the app

5. Click install and the app will open in a window

MOBILE:
1. On Android Chrome:
   - Visit your site URL
   - Tap menu (three dots) → "Install app"
   - App appears on home screen

2. On iOS (if using PWA-compatible browser):
   - Safari: Share → "Add to Home Screen"
   - This creates a shortcut (limited PWA support)


TESTING OFFLINE FUNCTIONALITY:
1. Install and launch the app
2. DevTools → Application → Service Workers
3. Check "Offline" checkbox
4. The app should still load and display cached pages

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Clear cache: DevTools → Application → Clear storage → Clear site data
- Reload page after clearing
- Service worker should re-install automatically
- Check browser console for any error messages


FILES UPDATED:
- manifest.json - PWA metadata
- service-worker.js - Offline caching and syncing
- index.html - Better service worker registration
- admin-panel.html - Service worker registration

Your app is now ready to be installed!
