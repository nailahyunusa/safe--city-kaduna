  <h1>About SafeCity Kaduna</h1>

  <p>
    SafeCity is a modern digital crime-reporting platform designed to make communities 
    safer by enabling citizens to report incidents quickly, accurately, and anonymously. 
    The app bridges the communication gap between the public and security agencies, 
    providing real-time information that can support rapid response and early intervention.
  </p>
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    To empower communities with a fast, reliable, and secure way to report criminal 
    activities, helping authorities respond more effectively while promoting a safer 
    environment for everyone.
  </p>
  <h2>Why SafeCity Was Built</h2>
  <p>
    Many crimes go unreported due to fear, lack of access, or communication barriers. 
    SafeCity solves this by offering a simple platform that captures the user's name, 
    address, description of the incident, automatic GPS location, and time of report — 
    allowing security personnel to act immediately.
  </p>
  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>One-tap crime reporting</li>
    <li>Live GPS location</li>
    <li>Admin dashboard with map and table</li>
    <li>Secure local report storage</li>
    <li>User-friendly interface</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    To become Africa’s leading smart-safety reporting platform through the use of 
    technology, data, and innovation.
